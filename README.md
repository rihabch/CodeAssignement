# Code assignment
Implementation of an employee management application

Three existing parts:
- Shared project with shared models and messages throughout the application.
- API project used to send requests to the queue in order to manage data.
- Console app that is responsible for listening to requests sent in the queue, verifying data and managing the repository.

TBD:
- Improve the code :)
- Add more documentation
- Add tests
- Add CI / CD support
